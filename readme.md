# LibLoader

LibLoader - plugin that allows you to load 
libraries from .jar files at runtime


# Usage 

To load a .jar file as a library, you need to 
put it in the folder `/plugins/LibLoader/libs/`.
The libraries are loaded when the plugin is enabled.


# Commands


## /library list 

Permission: `library.list`

Shows a list of loaded and available for 
loading libraries

# WARNING

Even though the plugin allows you to reload the library. 
I highly recommend not doing this for the reason that the 
old classes remain loaded in the cache, which can lead to
some conflicts between old and new class

The plugin has not been properly tested, so most likely 
there are critical errors
